# Eclipse ThreadX Learning Samples

This repo contains sample projects for ThreadX and NetX Duo. 

## Get started

### Use GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is the preferred way to building and run these sample if you have your GitHub account enabled for this feature. Otherwise, you can still use it with the [local dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) or set up the toolchain by your own.
